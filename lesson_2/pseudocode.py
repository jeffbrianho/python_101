# 1) a function that returns the sum of two numbers

# 2) a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a 
#    string that is all those strings concatenated together

# 3) a function that takes a list of integers, and returns
#    a new list with every other element from the original list, 
#    starting with the first element. For instance:

# Keyword	Meaning
# START	start of the program
# SET	set a variable that we can use for later
# GET	retrieve input from user
# PRINT	display output to user
# READ	retrieve a value from a variable
# IF/ELSE IF/ELSE	show conditional branches in logic
# WHILE	show looping logic
# END	end of the program

# 1) START 
# make a function that takes 2 arguements and wil summate and print 
# get 2 variable numbers calling the function 
# print out the sum

# def summate(x, y):
#     print(int(x) + int(y))

# summate(8, 4)

# 2) START
# create a function that will take a list of string and return a string cacatenation
# SET a list of strings
# SET a function to take a list and will concatenate the list
# iterate throughout each element with for string in list
# create a super string to add to each other

# string_list = ['abd', 'def', 'ghi']

# for index in string_list:
#     print(string)
    

# 3) START 
# SET a list of integers
# Create a a function that iterates through a list
# use a range for the index to iterate through every other number and pring
# PRINT the integer

# every_other = ([1, 4, 7, 2, 5])
# index = 0
# while index < len(every_other):
#     print(every_other[index])
#     index += 2
    
START
SET a function that will take a String 
use a find method or iterate through string to see if it occurs 3x
index the location of the third time 
print the location
